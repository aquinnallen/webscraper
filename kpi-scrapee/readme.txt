Hello! This is an operationally specific and rudimentary webscraper.
It was created to aggregate program milestone data for the Changemakers Lab.

This tool, scrapee, reads a list of website names and substitutes them one by
one into the url https://wordpress.evergreen.edu/[websitename]/robots/ and visits
a specialized page on teammember's personal web pages designed to report aggregate
information into a single .csv file for display on group and program wide KPI boards.

Further web display code to be packaged separately.

Code written by Quinn Allen, Version 0.1b released Nov 10 2023.
