Hello! This is an operationally specific and rudimentary webscraper.
It was created to retrieve pages of basic apparent and house rental and sale data
from https://www.redfin.com in order to create a real-estate pricing data set for analysis
as part of resarch done in the Changemakers Lab program at the Evergreen state College.

This is a work in progress and has returned some usable html text to parse.

No parsing nor cleaing has been done yet. More to come.

Code written by Quinn Allen, Version 0.1b released Nov 10 2023.
